Weather/Climate
Benue State has a tropical subhumid climate, with two distinct seasons which are wet season 
and dry season. The wet season lasts for seven months is between April and October, while the
 dry season comes between November and March. Temperatures are generally very high during the
  day, particularly in March and April.

 inclement/debilitating weather conditions. Makurdi, the state capital, for example, records 
 average maximum and minimum daily temperatures of 35°C and 21°C in summer and 37°C and 16°C
  in winter, respectively.
