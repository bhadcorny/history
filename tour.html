            These sprawling hills were developed into a cattle ranch in 1983. 
            The ranch has all-year-round thriving vegetation which is due to the weather condition of
             the place. This ranch provides steady grazing areas for cattle. <br>

            The Montane Games reserve is one of the few reserves in the state that accommodates wild
             and rare animals in their natural state. I bet you didn’t even know that Benue state has

            </div>
            According to a story told about how the tributaries came to be, it is said that they
             existed after seven women from the Igede tribe willingly offered themselves to be sacrificed
              for their kinsmen to cross the river Oyongo. The story says that after the sacrifices the 
              river parted ways into seven parts. The seven parts are still present today! <br>

            In this location, one can see the rare African manatee in their natural habitat.
